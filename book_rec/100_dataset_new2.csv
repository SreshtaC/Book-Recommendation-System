2,The Diary of a Young Girl,"Frank, Anne","Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank's remarkable diary has become a world classic-a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the ""Secret Annexe"" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.",English,"Nonfiction, Classics, History, Biography, Memoir, Historical, Holocaust, Autobiography, War, World War II",Amsterdam (Netherlands),283,Bantam,1993,4.15,2741134

Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.It is no secret that Alcott based Little Women on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with ""woman's work,"" including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the ""girl's book"" her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.",English,"Classics, Fiction, Historical Fiction, Young Adult, Romance, Historical, Literature, Childrens, Classic Literature, Novels","Concord, Massachusetts (United States), Massachusetts (United States), London, England, New England (United States)",449,Signet Classics,2004,4.09,1681583
