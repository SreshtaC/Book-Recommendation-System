# Book-Recommendation-System

**This is a book recommendation system that combines a unique mix of approaches which include:** 
- content-based learning (cosine similarity)
- sentiment analysis and user feedback
- a popularity-based approach with user ratings
- restriction mode (to recommend the books based on user's age)

Natural Language Preprocessing is done on the dataset obtained from Kaggle. The system uses Python libraries such as ***nltk, spacy, sci-kit learn*** for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, as well as ***pandas and numpy***. The recommendation system's user interface is done using Tkinter GUI.
